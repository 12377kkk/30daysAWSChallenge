### AWS benifits
1. On-demand access to over 175 services cloud-based services- Available at any time that you want to use it. With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. You have full control over the instance's lifecycle you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. You pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are in the running state, with a 60-second minimum.

2. Pay-as-you-go pricing- A pay-as-you-go model has a low upfront cost all the customer has to pay for is what they're going to use right away. This low level of investment often leads to customers making a quicker purchase decision. They also like how pay-as-you-go puts them in control. They won't pay for anything they don't use.

3. No upfront capital expenses or commitments- No need for operating expenses, such as property-related costs, equipment, production materials, and future business ventures.

4. Access of toolbox- with AWS you have access to a toolbox of services that you might not need otherwise be able to afford. Such services includes machine learning, analytics,IOT and high end security services.

### AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS is a cloud computing platform which is globally available. Global infrastructure is a region around the world in which AWS is based. Global infrastructure is a bunch of high-level IT services.
AWS is available in 19 regions, and 57 availability zones in December 2018 and 5 more regions 15 more availability zones for 2019.
The following are the components that make up the AWS infrastructure:

1.Availability Zones- An availability zone is a facility that can be somewhere in a country or in a city. Inside this facility, i.e., Data Centre, we can have multiple servers, switches, load balancing, firewalls. The things which interact with the cloud sits inside the data centers.

2.Region-A region is a geographical area. Each region consists of 2 more availability zones. A region is a collection of data centers which are completely isolated from other regions. A region consists of more than two availability zones connected to each other through links.

3.Edge locations- Edge locations are the endpoints for AWS used for caching content. Edge locations consist of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN). Edge locations are more than regions. Currently, there are over 150 edge locations. Edge location is not a region but a small location that AWS have. It is used for caching the content.

4.Regional Edge Caches-AWS announced a new type of edge location in November 2016, known as a Regional Edge Cache. Regional Edge cache lies between CloudFront Origin servers and the edge locations. A regional edge cache has a large cache than an individual edge location. Data is removed from the cache at the edge location while the data is retained at the Regional Edge Caches.

### AWS Global Infrastructure benifits
1.Flexible -AWS enables you to select the operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services you need. With AWS, you receive a virtual environment that lets you load the software and services your application requires. This eases the migration process for existing applications while preserving options for building new solutions.

2.Cost-Effective-You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments. For more information on comparing the costs of other hosting alternatives with AWS, see the AWS Economics Center.

3.Reliable-With AWS, you take advantage of a scalable, reliable, and secure global computing infrastructure, the virtual backbone of Amazon.com’s multi-billion dollar online business that has been honed for over a decade.

4.Scalable and high-performance-Using AWS tools, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing, your application can scale up or down based on demand. Backed by Amazon’s massive infrastructure, you have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.

5.Secure-AWS utilizes an end-to-end approach to secure and harden our infrastructure, including physical, operational, and software measures. For more information, see the AWS Security Center.

### Shared responsibility
This shared model can help relieve the customer’s operational burden as AWS operates, manages and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates. The nature of this shared responsibility also provides the flexibility and customer control that permits the deployment.
It is divides into two parts:
AWS and Customers:
AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, and the customer is responsible for the security in the cloud.

### AWS Well-Architected Framework
The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS. Using the Framework helps you learn architectural best practices for designing and operating secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement. The process for reviewing an architecture is a constructive conversation about architectural decisions, and is not an audit mechanism. We believe that having well-architected systems greatly increases the likelihood of business success.
